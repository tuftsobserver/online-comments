                Hi! So I'm thinking about how veganism actually erases the cultures of people of color of which cooking/eating meat is a big part.

                The production of meat products produces vastly larger amounts of pollution than the production of plant-based products, so to fight climate change and global warming. One cow can produce up to 120kg of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in one year. There are an estimated 88.5million cows in the United States. This means that in a year, these cows produce 10.2 BILLION kilograms of methane! Plants consume carbon dioxide and release pure clean oxygen for us to breathe!

                Posting stupid false memes instead of having a productive conversation is part of the problem.

                Hey, while I acknowledge your attempt to diffuse what is about to be a tense situation with humor, I think that this is distracting from an important discussion about veganism on campus and student experiences.

              <div class="comment" id="c2a" hidden>
                <div id="comment-author-name">

                </div>
                I think about veganism a lot, and I think it can be a force that erases people with different dietary needs. For example, people who are allergic to nuts may not be able to eat a nutritionally appropriate amount of protein. This resolution could force an unhealthy diet on people who do not have any option but to eat meat.

                Again, I see how you're using humor to try to diffuse the tension with humor, but you're just silencing actual conversations that are really important to me and to a lot of other people on this campus.

                Hi so I want to complicate this. Veganism is a vehicle for white supremacy, and posting about it is a performative attempt to obtain white social capital. It also is a classist ideology, as expecting people to sustain themselves on a plant-based diet is expensive. Before marginalizing these communities, think about your reasons for posting.

                </div>
                The Engagor: I see your point about how veganism can be a classist ideology, but this seems overly esoteric and not related to the substance of this proposition. Everyone has the same access to the same food at Tufts, so I think it's more important to look at people who feel as though their cultures are being erased by this oppressive resolution.

                While it is absolutely important to recognize the detrimental effects the meat production industry is having on our climate, we should also note that the mass consumption of fossil fuels and their derivatives has contributed vastly more to climate change than cattle in the United States. Also, we should be critical of the USâ€™s role in starting wars and destabilizing the Middle East in order to obtain oil.
