                Hi! So I'm thinking about how veganism actually erases the cultures of people of color of which cooking/eating meat is a big part.

                Academic:
                The production of meat products produces vastly larger amounts of pollution than the production of plant-based products, so to fight climate change and global warming. One cow can produce up to 120kg of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in one year. There are an estimated 88.5million cows in the United States. This means that in a year, these cows produce 10.2 BILLION kilograms of methane! Plants consume carbon dioxide and release pure clean oxygen for us to breathe!

                Posting stupid false memes instead of having a productive conversation is part of the problem.

                Critically Compassionate:
                Hey, while I acknowledge your attempt to diffuse what is about to be a tense situation with humor, I think that this is distracting from an important discussion about veganism on campus and student experiences.
